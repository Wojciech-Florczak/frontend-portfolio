## Goal
I'm recreating a website based on a photo of the template.  
This exercise is part of the coding assignment which I have to complete to participate in the bootcamp.

## Different branches
I decided to make two branches in this repository.  
The first one will have raw version of project with placeholder images and text.  
The second one will have version filled with my personal data.

## Glitch.com
As a part of this exercise, I had to create this project at [Glitch.com](https://www.glitch.com "Glitch Homepage"), but I find out that I can just import GitHub repository there so I did that, and now I can write code in my code editor and track progress on my GitHub.
I will also provide link when project will be ready.
